# 🩺 Schedula Backend

Schedula is a medical appointment booking system built with a modular, scalable backend using **NestJS** and **PostgreSQL**. The backend supports role-based authentication, doctor availability scheduling, time slot generation, and secure appointment booking — with features tailored for stream and wave consultation modes.

## 🔐 Authentication

Schedula uses a hybrid authentication system:

- **Local Auth**: Email + password with role-based token issuance.
- **JWT**: Custom access tokens include `user_id` and `role`, verified via `JwtAuthGuard`. Tokens are used to authorize doctor/patient access per route.
- **Google OAuth**: 
  - Implemented using `passport-google-oauth20`.
  - On successful login, user details are matched or created in the database.
  - A custom JWT is then issued for internal auth flows.

➡️ OAuth is mainly used for **patient login** to simplify onboarding.

## 🕒 Scheduling Logic

Doctors can set availability in **stream** or **wave** mode:
- **Stream Mode**: Each 30-min slot = 1 patient.
- **Wave Mode**: Slots accept up to `max_patients`, all booked at the same time.

Bookings are only allowed:
- Within doctor’s available slots.
- Before consultation start time (with UTC-IST checks).

## 📤 Deployment

> **URL**: https://schedula-backend-arnav.onrender.com  
Live API hosted on **Render** with CI/CD configured.

---

## 🧪 Testing (Planned)

- Unit tests with **Jest**
- Test cases for auth, scheduling, booking
- Postman collection for API testing
